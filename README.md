Restaurant Reservation Platform
This platform, built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js),
streamlines the process of booking restaurant tables. It provides users with an intuitive interface
to check table availability, make reservations, and receive confirmation in real-time. The system 
is designed to optimize resource allocation, reduce food waste, and enhance overall restaurant 
efficiency. With a focus on user experience, it allows restaurant managers to track bookings 
seamlessly and manage table occupancy effectively.
